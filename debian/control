Description: This package is DEPRECATED. Please use the urdfdom dependency directly instead of this package. This package contains a C++ parser for the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), which is an XML format for representing a robot model. The parser reads a URDF XML robot description, and creates a C++ URDF model. Although it is possible to directly use this parser when working with URDF robot descriptions, the preferred user API is found in the urdf package.
